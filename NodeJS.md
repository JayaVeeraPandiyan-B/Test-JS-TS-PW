Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser, typically on a server. It is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient.

**Use of Node.js:**
* Server-Side Development: Node.js is used to build fast and scalable server-side applications. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server.
* Non-Blocking I/O: Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it efficient for handling multiple requests simultaneously, ideal for real-time applications.
* Building APIs: Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs and backend services for web and mobile applications.
* Real-Time Applications: Perfect for applications like chat apps, online gaming, or live streaming, where real-time communication is critical.
* Cross-Platform Development: It supports creating cross-platform applications, especially when combined with frameworks like Electron.
* Single Programming Language: Developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, simplifying development and improving collaboration.
* NPM Ecosystem: Node.js has a vast library of open-source packages available through Node Package Manager (NPM), making development faster and easier.
* High Performance: Powered by Googleâ€™s V8 engine, Node.js executes JavaScript code quickly and efficiently.
* Microservices Architecture: It is widely used for building microservices due to its lightweight and modular nature.
* Scalability: Node.js is well-suited for applications that need to scale horizontally or vertically.
